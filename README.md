## Overview

Spatial intelligence unfolds through a perception-action loop: agents act to acquire observations, and reason about how observations vary as a function of action. Rather than passively processing what is *seen*, they actively uncover what is *unseen* — occluded structure, dynamics, containment, and functionality that cannot be resolved from passive sensing alone.

**ESI-Bench** moves beyond prior formulations of spatial intelligence that assume oracle observations by recasting the observer as an actor. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for embodied spatial intelligence spanning **10 task categories** and **29 subcategories** built on [OmniGibson](https://behavior.stanford.edu/omnigibson/), grounded in Spelke's core knowledge systems. Agents must decide what abilities to deploy — perception, locomotion, and manipulation — and how to sequence them to actively accumulate task-relevant evidence.

### Key Findings

- **Active exploration substantially outperforms passive counterparts**, with agents spontaneously discovering emergent spatial strategies without explicit instruction.
- **Passive multi-view adds noise rather than signal** despite consuming far more images.
- **Most failures stem from action blindness**: poor action choices lead to poor observations, which drive cascading errors.
- **Explicit 3D grounding stabilizes reasoning** on depth-sensitive tasks, but imperfect reconstruction proves more harmful than 2D baselines.
- **Models exhibit a metacognitive gap**: unlike humans who seek falsifying viewpoints and revise beliefs under contradiction, models commit prematurely with high confidence regardless of evidence quality.

## Active Exploration

The active exploration module loads an OmniGibson scene, captures step images, calls a GPT or Gemini model, and writes an `answer.json`.

### Environment Setup
**Note that the same as [BEHAVIOR-1K](https://github.com/StanfordVL/BEHAVIOR-1K), the simulator only works for graphical cards <= 40 series (e.g., 20 / 30 / 40 series), and if you use 50-series or blackwell GPUs and rendering results will be very bad.**

Use the existing `behavior` conda environment:

```bash
source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate behavior
```

Set one API key depending on the provider:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

OmniGibson and BEHAVIOR-1K assets are expected to be available from the conda environment and local machine setup.

#### Special OmniGibson Setting

Remove walls from the OmniGibson generated maps before running ESI-Bench. In your local OmniGibson source tree, edit `./asset_pipeline/b1k_pipeline/usd_conversion/make_maps.py` so that `NEEDED_STRUCTURE_CATEGORIES` only includes floor categories:

```python
WALL_CATEGORIES = ["walls", "rail_fence"]
FLOOR_CATEGORIES = ["floors", "driveway", "lawn"]
DOOR_CATEGORIES = ["door", "sliding_door", "garage_door", "gate"]
IGNORE_CATEGORIES = ["carpet"]
# NEEDED_STRUCTURE_CATEGORIES = FLOOR_CATEGORIES + WALL_CATEGORIES
NEEDED_STRUCTURE_CATEGORIES = FLOOR_CATEGORIES
```

Report setup problems in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/esibench/ESI-Bench/issues).

### Running the Explorer

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python src/main.py \
  --task spatial_segmentation \
  --metadata "dataset/json_clean/Enumerative Perception/Spatial Segmentation/Merom_0_int/living_room_0/q_000.json" \
  --provider gemini \
  --model gemini-3.1-pro-preview \
  --max-steps 30 \
  --min-steps 1 \
  --threshold 0.9 \
  --results-root outputs/results \
  --step-image-root outputs/steps \
  --overwrite
```

For GPT:

```bash
python src/main.py \
  --task connectivity \
  --metadata "dataset/json_clean/Cognitive Mapping.json" \
  --question-index 0 \
  --provider gpt \
  --model gpt-5 \
  --max-steps 30 \
  --min-steps 1 \
  --threshold 0.9 \
  --results-root outputs/results \
  --step-image-root outputs/steps \
  --overwrite
```

`--metadata` can be a single canonical question JSON under `dataset/json_clean`, or a big-task summary JSON such as `dataset/json_clean/Cognitive Mapping.json` containing `json_paths`. Use `--question-index` to select from a summary list.

See [`docs/run_tasks.md`](docs/run_tasks.md) for the full per-small-task `--task` list, summary JSON inputs, and example mappings.

### Task Names

`--task` names are now the 29 small-task names. For example:

```text
action_order_inference, connectivity, long_term_navigation,
category_ambiguity, spatial_segmentation, dimensional_size,
material_transparency, rigid_containment, geometric_configuration,
correspondence, agent_observation, unobserved_change
```

The legacy runner names from older scripts, such as `counting`, `cognitivemap`, or `mirror`, are still accepted as compatibility aliases, but new commands should use the small-task names. When a question JSON is provided, the runner also validates the JSON's `big_task` / `small_task` metadata and dispatches to the matching module under `src/active_explore/tasks/<category>/<small_task>.py`.

The input JSON directories follow the ESI-Bench table categories:

```text
Action Sequencing, Cognitive Mapping, Enumerative Perception,
Metric Comparison, Perceptual Grounding, Physical Dynamics,
Physical Structure, Spatial Relations, Specular Reflection,
Temporal Understanding
```

### Output Format

The runner writes:

- `answer.json` under `--results-root`
- `step_*.png` under `--step-image-root`

> **Note:** Smoke tests were run with `max_steps=1`, which verifies environment loading, rendering, model calls, and result writing. It is not a full accuracy evaluation for tasks that need multi-step physical interaction.

## Dataset Generation

Dataset construction scripts for all task categories live under [`src/dataset_generation/`](src/dataset_generation/). Each task folder contains a Python script and a corresponding bash runner. To generate data, activate the `behavior` environment and run the bash script for the task you want:

```bash
source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate behavior

# Example: generate occlusion data
bash src/dataset_generation/task_hallucination/batch_occlusion_contributor.sh

# Example: generate slope/stacking data
bash src/dataset_generation/task_physics/batch_slope.sh
bash src/dataset_generation/task_physics/batch_stack.sh
```

Set your API key before running any script that calls a model:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

The task folders and their scripts are:

| Folder | Scripts |
|---|---|
| `task_action_sequencing` | `batch_action` |
| `task_capacity` | `batch_pour`, `batch_storage`, `batch_storage_multi`, `batch_water` |
| `task_cognitive_map` | `batch_cognitivemap_connect`, `batch_cognitivemap_merge`, `batch_cognitivemap_plan`, `batch_cognitivemap_region` |
| `task_comparison` | `batch_distance`, `batch_size`, `batch_size_robot` |
| `task_confusing_relation` | `batch_equilateral`, `batch_isosceles`, `batch_randomtriangle`, `batch_line`, `batch_line_positive`, `batch_touching`, `batch_touching_false`, `batch_touching_real` |
| `task_counting` | `batch_counting_merge` |
| `task_deformable` | `batch_deformable` |
| `task_hallucination` | `batch_angle_confusion`, `batch_angle_confusion_contributor`, `batch_dependency`, `batch_occlusion`, `batch_occlusion_contributor`, `batch_transparent`, `batch_transparent_false` |
| `task_mirror` | `batch_mirror_correspondence`, `batch_mirror_distance`, `batch_mirror_merge`, `batch_mirror_object_reality` |
| `task_multi_agent` | `batch_multi_agent` |
| `task_physics` | `batch_slope`, `batch_stack` |
| `task_unobserved_changes` | `batch_unobserved_changes` |
